# Qualitative Research Analysis: OMT Scholarship Review Process Interview

## 1. Interviewee Role & Background
- Role: Science/STEM scholarship application reviewer
- Background: Science and mathematics expertise
- Years of Experience: Since around 2019 (pre-COVID)
- Discipline: Reviews science applications across various sub-disciplines

## 2. Current Review Process Description
- Previously manual process using Excel spreadsheets
- Transitioned to software platform in past year
- Reviews applications against a comprehensive rubric
- Evaluates academic transcripts, research proposals, and personal stories
- Scoring scale: 0-4 rating system

## 3. Pain Points & Challenges
- Cold start problem with first few applications
- Difficulty establishing initial benchmark/reference point
- Challenge of comparing across diverse research domains
- Struggles with final assessment and summation of candidate evaluation
- Large scoring bin sizes (0-4) create nuance challenges
- Memory limitations between yearly review cycles

## 4. What They Value in Applications
- Compelling personal narrative of resilience
- Research with broad social impact
- Solutions addressing fundamental problems
- Preference for work benefiting "bottom of the pyramid"
- Meets minimum academic requirements
- Research potential to help many people
- Ability to solve immediate, tangible challenges

## 5. Views on AI/Technology
- Strongly advocates "human in the loop" approach
- Wants AI to handle algorithmic/rubric scoring
- Rejects fully autonomous systems
- Believes current AI lacks genuine reasoning capabilities
- Sees AI as useful for statistical pattern matching
- Wants human judgment for empathy, nuance, and final decision-making

## 6. Suggestions & Ideas
- Thematic grouping of applications annually
- Subject matter expert consultation for specialized domains
- Institutional memory tracking between review cycles
- More granular scoring mechanism
- Automated handling of routine, algorithmic review elements

## 7. Key Direct Quotes
1. "The story matters... with the biggest weighting here."
2. "AI is good at using rubrics... reading documents without any emotion"
3. "I might be throwing away the next Nobel Prize winner because it doesn't look appealing"
4. "I have a personal bias towards impact programs that help the bottom of the pyramid"
5. "AI as it is can't reason. It's purely statistical, probabilistic."

## 8. Unique Insights
- Explicit acknowledgment and active management of personal biases
- Nuanced understanding of AI's current limitations
- Strong emphasis on human narrative and resilience beyond pure academic metrics
- Contextual approach prioritizing local (South African) impact
- Recognition of uneven application preparation across different educational institutions
