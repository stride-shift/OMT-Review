# Qualitative Interview Analysis for OMT Scholarship Review Process

## 1. Interviewee Role & Background
- Role: Professor of Statistical Sciences at University of Cape Town
- Discipline: Biostatistics, applied health research
- Research Areas: Dermatology, cardiology, infectious diseases
- OMT Experience: Multiple years reviewing applications, previously received OMT sabbatical funding
- Professional Credentials: C1 NRF rating, Associate Editor for Journal of Applied Statistics and Biometrics

## 2. Current Review Process Description
- Starts by reading entire portfolio/proposal thoroughly
- Refers to standardized OMT rubric with category-specific criteria
- Evaluates differently based on application level (masters vs. postdoc vs. sabbatical)
- Looks for:
  * Research innovation
  * Academic background
  * Potential social impact
  * Publication quality
  * Proposed institution/research plan
- Uses comparative benchmarking across past reviews

## 3. Pain Points & Challenges
- Publication assessment lacks clear guidelines
- Unclear how to evaluate research impact metrics
- Rubric heavily based on NRF model
- Difficulty assessing research quality without deep domain expertise
- Inconsistent guidance on evaluating scholarly contributions

## 4. What They Value in Applications
- Innovative research proposals
- Strong academic background
- Clear social impact potential
- Alignment between proposed research and career trajectory
- Quality of proposed overseas institution
- Comprehensive and articulate portfolio

## 5. Views on AI/Technology
- Open to technological assistance
- Would delegate:
  * Research background verification
  * Bibliometric analysis
  * Checklist/summary preparation
- Wants human oversight for final judgment
- Values transparency and depth of analysis

## 6. Suggestions & Ideas
- Separate evaluation criteria for coursework vs. dissertation masters
- Provide cross-reviewer score comparisons
- Implement a consensus/moderation process
- More explicit guidance on assessing scholarly contributions
- Clearer metrics for publication quality

## 7. Key Direct Quotes
1. "You're not told how you should assess the publications... you really have to apply yourself."
2. "I would like to know of the reviews that we have given, do they take a sort of combination of scores from the group?"
3. "The rubric is built on an NRF kind of model... the only thing that has been added is this social responsive impact."
4. "I still think as a reviewer you still want to read the portfolio."
5. "If you just have a number and you have a high Google Scholar H-index, maybe you go with that."

## 8. Unique Insights
- Comparative approach to reviewing across multiple research assessment contexts
- Nuanced understanding of evolving academic evaluation methods
- Emphasis on holistic assessment beyond simple numerical metrics
- Recognition of changing master's degree structures across disciplines
