  - Background in consulting, financial data warehousing, mobile technology, and climate ventures
- Expertise Areas: Strategy, innovation, financial technology, economic development

## 2. Current Review Process Description
- Reads all application documents thoroughly over several nights
- Two-step assessment methodology:
  1. Evaluate submission on its own merit
  2. Use "relativity" to calibrate between similar applications
- Follows OMT rubric while incorporating subjective judgment
- Spends significant time analyzing each application's depth and potential
- Checks candidate's background, institutional performance, and delivery probability

## 3. Pain Points & Challenges
- Feels "pigeonholed" into financial application reviews
- Rubric categories like "extraordinary talent" are too subjective
- Low student throughput rates in national funding programs
- Difficulty assessing genuine motivation from potentially AI-generated letters
- Challenges in evaluating candidates from different cultural/linguistic backgrounds

## 4. What They Value in Applications
- Probability of actually delivering the proposed work
- Candidate's "skin in the game"
- Authentic reference letters from genuine mentors
- Demonstrated commitment and action, not just intent
- Potential for creating broader impact
- Candidate's capacity to complete academic obligations

## 5. Views on AI/Technology
- Positive about AI for binary/factual tasks
- Wants AI to:
  - Handle budget verification
  - Conduct database searches
  - Perform psychographic analysis
  - Verify institutional performance
- Skeptical about AI assessing future potential
- Warns against AI's bias toward historical data
- Sees AI as a "cognitive assistant" to reduce superfluous work

## 6. Suggestions & Ideas
- Make "extraordinary talent" category more scientifically defined
- Create a more curated scholarship experience
- Develop tools to support candidates from diverse backgrounds
- Use AI for initial fact-finding and verification
- Consider candidates' potential beyond current specializations

## 7. Key Direct Quotes
1. "Ultimately it's not quite simply about the merit of the intent... It's about the probability of that being delivered."
2. "I think humanity's future is based on humanity's capability and it will always be something between what we know and the choices we make."
3. "AI right now... is built on data that is in the internet... by its very nature AI would go on historic trends when all of us know that the future is not told by history alone."
4. "We have a treasure trove of people who want to make this place better and we're using tools that could all be improved."
