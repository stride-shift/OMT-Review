After carefully reviewing the transcript, I realize this document does not actually contain the discovery interview with Ndumiso Luthuli about the OMT scholarship review process. Instead, this appears to be a preliminary technical discussion between Justin Germishuys and Barbara Dale-Jones about scheduling and AI performance.

The transcript does not provide substantive information to complete the requested analysis about the OMT scholarship review process. Key sections like interview content with Ndumiso Luthuli are missing.

To properly conduct the requested qualitative research analysis, I would need:
1. The actual interview transcript with Ndumiso Luthuli
2. More context about their role in the OMT scholarship review process
3. Detailed discussion of their current review procedures and perspectives

Would you like me to:
- Confirm if there are additional transcript pages
- Discuss how I would approach this analysis if the full interview were available
- Provide a template for the requested structured analysis

How would you like to proceed?
