**Role in OMT Review Process:**
- Reviewer/adjudicator for postgraduate scholarship applications
- Provides scoring and written rationale for applications
- Does not make final funding recommendations; only returns scores

**Duration of Involvement:**
- Approximately three years (as of January 2026)

**Discipline/Expertise Area:**
- Metallurgical Engineering Department, University of Pretoria
- Background spanning industry (17-20 years) and academia (9 years initially, returned in 2015)
- Teaches postgraduate honors program and supervises final-year research projects
- Also reviews admissions for his own university's postgraduate program

## 2. Current Review Process Description

**Overall Process Structure:**

The review process follows a three-phase approach:

**Phase 1: Initial Scan (5 minutes)**
- Quick overview of applicant pool to understand "who they are"
- Gets a sense of the group before deep review

**Phase 2: Detailed Document Review (45 minutes to 1 hour per applicant)**
- Conducted in evenings, typically across 2-3 evening sessions
- Reads every document in a single sitting for each application
- Checks for discrepancies and consistencies
- Does not take extensive notes during this phase
- Completes the evaluation form without finalizing scores

**Phase 3: Consistency Check & Finalization (~20 minutes)**
- Reviews overall ratings after completing all applications
- Looks for outliers and halo effects
- Checks personal work for consistency before submitting
- Finalizes scores at this point

**Tools & Systems Currently Used:**
- Web-based system (described as "quite slick")
- Evaluation form with rubric
- Spreadsheet previously used (described as "very clunky")
- Manual timeline creation for tracking applicant academic history gaps

**Time Commitment:**
- 2-3 evenings total (approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour × number of applicants + 20 minutes review)
- Typically works within the given 2-week turnaround time, though prefers to complete detailed phase well ahead of deadline

## 3. Pain Points & Challenges

**Primary Frustrations:**

1. **Determining True Motivation (Most Significant Pain Point)**
   - Difficulty distinguishing genuine commitment from last-resort applications
   - Uncertainty about whether funding supports career development or enables emigration
   - Example cited: suspecting sabbatical applicants may be using OMT as fallback

2. **Timeline/Academic Record Compilation (Tedious/Superfluous Cognitive Load)**
   - Compiling coherent timelines from diverse academic records across different institutions
   - Tracking gaps in education/employment across formats (B.Tech, B.Sc, etc.)
   - Must manually create diagrams to understand applicant's academic progression
   - Describes this as "quite tedious"

3. **Halo Effect Management**
   - Risk of bias toward applications in familiar research areas
   - Consciously forcing "extreme" scoring initially to counteract this

4. **Tight Deadline Pressure**
   - Preference to work well ahead of 2-week turnaround to allow "sleeping on it"
   - Currently works closer to deadline than ideal
   - Acknowledges this is self-management issue rather than OMT's fault

5. **Lack of Context on Review Process**
   - Doesn't know whether he's one of 2 or one of 5 reviewers
   - Prefers not to know to avoid second-guessing his judgment
   - Uncomfortable with calibration against previous cohorts due to time gaps and different applicant mixes

6. **Rubric Limitations (Minor)**
   - Acknowledges rubrics are "by definition limiting"
   - Forces difficult binary decisions
   - However, notes this isn't necessarily disadvantageous

---

## 4. What They Value in Applications

**Key Evaluation Criteria:**

1. **High Integrity & High Caliber (Primary)**
   - "OMT plays great store on sort of well clearly on high integrity, high caliber applications"
   - Seeking intellectually capable individuals

2. **Community Contribution & Return to South Africa (Highly Important)**
   - Assesses whether funding builds domestic or international talent pools
   - Questions: "How deep are the ties to South Africa?"
   - Explicit concern about "funding them to immigrate or funding them to come back"
   - Views as "somewhat old-fashioned" but important consideration

3. **Career Coherence & Trajectory**
   - "Does it make sense?" - broad strokes assessment
   - How the application moves specific applicant's career in a specific direction
   - Examines whether postgraduate plans align with background

4. **Applicant Context & Motivation**
   - Considers socioeconomic background and personal circumstances
   - Example: recognizes how medical emergency influenced applicant's field choice
   - Acknowledges need to look at "social context" while not favoring mediocrity from disadvantaged backgrounds
   - Distinction between excellent candidates and mediocre ones from impoverished contexts

5. **Consistency & Integrity of Application Materials**
   - Checks for discrepancies between documents
   - Verifies department references against university websites
   - Notes applications are "vetted and scrubbed quite carefully"
   - Has found few major inconsistencies

6. **Authenticity of Purpose**
   - Struggles most with determining true motivation
   - Seeks to understand what is "really driving" the applicant
   - Concerned with distinguishing genuine pursuit from desperation

**Red Flags:**
- Applicants unlikely to return to/contribute to South Africa
- Gaps in academic timeline without clear explanation
- Applications that feel like "last resort" (no genuine motivation apparent)
- Weak career narrative despite strong credentials

**What Makes Applications Stand Out:**
- Clear personal context that explains field choice/motivation
- Coherent career trajectory with meaningful progression
- Evidence of commitment to contributing to South African community
- Strong intellectual capability paired with integrity
- Memorable applications are "very memorable" and remain vivid years later

**Weighting of Factors:**
- Confidence high in academic merit assessment (own domain expertise)
- Lower confidence in motivation assessment
- Uses rubric to systematize evaluation but doesn't rely purely on it
- Willing to critically re-examine when intuition conflicts with rubric score

## 5. Views on AI/Technology

**Overall Attitude: Cautiously Skeptical/Lukewarm**

**General Philosophy:**
- "I'm somewhat cynical about AI"
- Acknowledges it's useful but not a panacea
- Personal experience with AI in undergraduate context (detecting AI-generated reports)
- Recognizes AI "is not going to go away" and could help "in ways I probably cannot imagine"

**Concerns About AI Implementation:**

1. **Double Measurement Problem**
   - "It is like measuring something twice. The two measurements will differ. Now you have to explain three things: the first measurement, the second measurement, and the difference."
   - Skeptical this adds value

2. **Human Decision-Making Essential**
   - "Eventually the human being must make a final call"
   - Rules out AI for final decisions
   - Firm on this requirement

3. **Lack of Visibility into Other Reviewers**
   - Prefers not to know number of reviewers to avoid second-guessing
   - Concern about calibration and consensus

**What AI Could Help With (Potential Use Cases):**

1. **Initial Screening (High Value)**
   - Reducing "superfluous cognitive load"
   - Filtering out "obviously low caliber ones"
   - Automatic elimination of inconsistencies

2. **Timeline/Academic Record Compilation (High Value)**
   - Compiling coherent timelines from diverse academic records
   - Identifying and flagging gaps in progression
   - Making sense of different qualification formats (B.Tech vs. B.Sc, etc.)
   - Described as "completely different level" of tedious work in his university admissions role

3. **Structural Support**
   - Helping "give structures to an issue"
   - Making initial "skilling" work easier

**What Should NOT Be Automated:**
- Final decision-making
- Motivation assessment
- Context evaluation
- Integrity/caliber judgment
- Edge case decisions (choosing between close candidates)

**Required Trust & Transparency:**
- Would want visibility into how AI reached its decisions
- Needs clear explanation of AI scoring rationale
- Must understand differences between AI assessment and human assessment
- Concerned about "second-guessing what other people may say or may not say"

**Experimental Interest:**
- Open to running experiment to test whether AI-initial-scoring "would really change things or make it easier"
- Willing to try if properly structured

## 6. Suggestions & Ideas

**Process Improvements Suggested:**

1. **Self-Management/Deadline Optimization (Primary)**
   - Start detailed review phase well ahead of deadline
   - Allow time to "sleep on it" before finalizing
   - Benefit of web-based system: can leave scores sitting and return to review with fresh perspective
   - Not OMT's responsibility but reviewer discipline ("it depends on how I manage myself")

2. **AI-Assisted Initial Screening (Clear Priority)**
   - Implement AI to handle tedious timeline/gap analysis
   - Auto-flag inconsistencies and obviously low-caliber applications
   - Reduce cognitive load on human reviewers for tedious documentation work
   - Would significantly help with mixed academic record formats

3. **Better Academic Record Standardization** (Implied)
   - Applications currently come in different formats from different institutions
   - Standardizing or AI-organizing these could save significant time

4. **Preserving Human Judgment on Key Dimensions**
   - Keep human review for motivation, context, integrity assessment
   - Maintain human review for edge cases

5. **Rubric Enhancement** (Minor)
   - Current rubric is "quite useful" and "reasonably well thought out"
   - No major changes suggested
   - Pieter satisfied with 4-5 point scale (avoids obscure fine-tuning of 10-point scales)

**Features/Capabilities Desired:**
- Clear timeline visualization of applicant's academic/career progression
- Automated consistency checking
- Structured flagging of information gaps
- Preservation of human decision authority
- Transparency in how AI reaches initial scores

**Priorities for Change:**
1. **High Priority:** Automate tedious timeline compilation and gap analysis
2. **High Priority:** Initial screening to filter obvious low-caliber candidates
3. **Medium Priority:** Review process timing/deadline management (self-directed)
4. **Low Priority:** Rubric revision (current system working well)

## 7. Key Direct Quotes

### Quote 1: On True Motivation Assessment (Primary Pain Point)
**Context:** Discussing where he feels least confident in judgment

> "The least confident is probably this consideration of what is the true motivation... Sometimes I work it out sometimes I don't... There was somebody that applied for support for a sabbatical leave... I got this sense that he or she was that this was the sort of point of application of the last resort... What I quite often struggle with is to find out the motivation. What is really driving this specific individual?"

**Significance:** Identifies the core challenge in application review—understanding authentic intent versus desperation.

---

### Quote 2: On South Africa Retention Concern
**Context:** Discussing career fit and what makes applications stand out

> "Something else that I tend also to check is you know what are the chances... but you know how deep are the ties to South Africa... These are high caliber people... Are you funding them to immigrate or are you funding them to come back and in some way enrich South Africa... You can spend a lot of money to build a US or a European talent pool. I don't think that is the intention."

**Significance:** Reveals core value alignment with OMT mission and a major evaluation criterion that's subtle but essential.

---

### Quote 3: On Rubric vs. Intuition Resolution
**Context:** Discussing how to handle discrepancies between gut feeling and rubric score

> "I would follow the rubric. If there's a discrepancy... I'll go and take a look and say why is it lower, and I tend to go back to the individual parameters and look at that again. But I wouldn't sort of push it towards my first intuition... Quite often what I see is that the rubric is actually okay... This individual looked very impressive, but if you look at the details, maybe it wasn't... So I wouldn't rework my scoring to get to my first answer."

**Significance:** Shows sophisticated metacognitive approach to bias management and rubric use; prioritizes systematic evaluation over intuition.

---

### Quote 4: On Context & Social Background Evaluation
**Context:** Justin asks about role of applicant's context; Pieter provides example

> "There was a student... his father had a major medical emergency and he was severely incapacitated when he was a teenager and based on what he saw there he decided to go into medical engineering... You need to look at that... We see the same with our students... Some come from absolutely middle class environments, some you can see that the clothes that they wear when they sit in front of you is the clothes that they have... You need to look at that... You need to balance this... Someone that comes from an impoverished neighborhood may be excellent or mediocre. I don't think our idea is to support a mediocre candidate but you need to look at the social context."

**Significance:** Demonstrates nuanced understanding of contextual factors; shows willingness to consider hardship without lowering standards.

---

### Quote 5: On Cynicism Toward AI & Human Decision Authority
**Context:** Discussing potential role of AI in review process

> "I'm somewhat cynical about AI... It is like measuring something twice. The two measurements will differ. Now you have to explain three things: the first measurement, the second measurement, and the difference... Eventually the human being must make a final call... It's not going to go away and I think it could help in ways which I probably cannot imagine."

**Significance:** Captures the cautious pragmatism—sees value but not cure-all; insists on human judgment authority.

---

### Quote 6: On Superfluous Cognitive Load
**Context:** Discussing what AI could help with

> "I would think that is probably... if you look at a CV or the combination of a CV and academic record is to say but is there a gap... That sort of... can be quite tedious... I sometimes draw out a little diagram... Almost to compile a timeline... to look at gaps and understand what has happened... I think that would help quite a bit."

**Significance:** Identifies specific, quantifiable pain point where automation would have highest impact.

---

### Quote 7: On The Humbling & Inspiring Nature of Review
**Context:** Closing remarks reflecting on the process

> "It is always quite a humbling experience... The caliber of the candidates... I get a feeling sometimes you know it's quite often quite a humbling experience to realize that we are people with significant intellectual capability and they are really managing their lives well and they look towards other people around them as well... It's really quite inspiring... You know it is a lot of hours that you burn but you know it's once a year so it's not a catastrophe."

**Significance:** Reveals deeper motivation for careful review; suggests emotional investment in process; frames effort as worthwhile despite time cost.

---

### Quote 8: On Not Benchmarking Against Previous Cohorts
**Context:** Discussing whether memories of previous candidates help or hinder

> "I try to look at that cohort in itself... To benchmark would be difficult I think because the processes are so far apart and of course you know I may get a different mix... I on purpose I don't try to benchmark... I think they asked me because they value my opinion not to calibrate to support what the eventual decision was."

**Significance:** Shows awareness of potential bias and commitment to independent judgment; resists institutional pressure for consistency.

---

### Quote 9: On Preference for Not Knowing Reviewer Ensemble
**Context:** Asked about visibility into other reviewers and review structure

> "I don't have any visibility on that. And you know, I don't think it would affect my decision-making. So, I'd rather not know... I try to look at it based on my own judgment and not to sort of second guess what other people may say or may not say."

**Significance:** Reveals preference for independence and potential concern about groupthink; wants autonomy.

---

### Quote 10: On The Writing of Rationale
**Context:** Discussing extent of motivation/rationale documentation

> "I tend to limit myself to about two or three sentences, you know. No, not an essay... I don't have visibility on how many reviewers there are... I'd rather not know."

**Significance:** Indicates efficient but minimal documentation; paired with rationale implies practical approach to process rather than comprehensive explanation-building.

## 8. Unique Insights

### 1. **The "Deep Ties to South Africa" Criterion as Core Mission Alignment**
Pieter explicitly frames applicant retention/return to South Africa as a core criterion, but it's framed philosophically ("somewhat old-fashioned and naive") rather than operationally. This is distinctive—most reviewers might not articulate this as clearly or defend it as persistently. **Insight for OMT:** This may not be systematically measured in the rubric but is clearly important. The AI initial screening could specifically flag indicators of this (permanent residence status, family ties, expressed career intentions in SA, etc.).
